MetaModel extras
================

Extra pluggable modules for Apache MetaModel.

These include:

 * SAS (.sas7bdat) file reading - largely based on a port of the work by Matt Shotwell (https://github.com/biostatmatt/sas7bdat)
 * DBase (.dbf) database file reading (largely based on the XBase project)
 * Microsoft Access (.mdb and .accdb) file reading (largely based on the Jackcess project)

Since many of these dependencies are LGPL licensed, they are not fit for inclusion into Apache. But the aim of this project is to make it available for users of Apache MetaModel who are also willing to accept LGPL license terms.

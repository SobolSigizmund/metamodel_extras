metamodel_extras
================

Extra pluggable modules for Apache MetaModel (but licensed with LGPL)

These include:

 * SAS (.sas7bdat) file reading - largely based on a port of the work by Matt Shotwell (https://github.com/biostatmatt/sas7bdat)
 * DBase (.dbf) database file reading (largely based on the XBase project)
 * Microsoft Access (.mdb and .accdb) file reading (largely based on the Jackcess project)
